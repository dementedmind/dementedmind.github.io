                <p>A Times of India story tells us that the shareholders of IDFC, the holding company of IDFC First Bank, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/idfc-shareholders-deny-board-seat-to-vinod-rai/articleshow/86438467.cms">had denied a board seat</a> to Vinod Rai. </p>
<p>Who is this Vinod Rai ?</p>
<p>Yes, this is the <strong>only</strong>  <strong>Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)</strong> (past, present and possibly future) whose name is and possibly will be familiar with middle class people including me, who invented the concept of <strong>notional loss</strong> to the Exchequer with some innovative arithmetic  in the allotment of telecom spectrum. A corrupt Government became more corrupt and an authentic value of Rs 1.76 Lakh crore as a measure was informed to middle class.</p>
<p>Mr Rai overnight becomes hero of middle class - Crusader against Corruption in high places, fearless man not afraid to go against high and mighty,a man whom the history would serenade as the most noble and most intrepid CAG India has had. </p>
<p>Now the same man has been disowned by shareholders of IDFC. why ?</p>
<p>Times of india writes:</p>
<p>"<em>Rai was earlier the independent director of IDFC for two terms. As it was not possible
to get a third term as an independent director, Rai had resigned before the second
term could end in July. However, he was reappointed as a non-independent, non-
executive director and shareholder approval was sought to ratify the same. In a pre-
AGM investor call, shareholders had questioned why Rai’s resignation had not been
made public. Responding to the queries, Ajay Sondhi, a director, had said that as Rai’s
second term as an independent director was coming to an end, IDFC’s board and the
nomination &amp; remunerations committee (NRC) felt that it is in the best interest of the
company and shareholders to ensure continuity of Rai’s tenure as chairman especially
in IDFC’s critical final phase in terms of unlocking shareholder value.</em>"</p>
<p>To a layman like me who is ignorant of Corporate Laws and Affairs, however knows that position of "independent director" is a device used by corporate to reward and express gratitude for past actions. It appears that dramatis personae of 24-carat integrity have not kept on the straight and narrow.</p>
