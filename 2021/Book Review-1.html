                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Memory_Police">The Memory Police</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Dko_Ogawa">Yoko Ogawa</a> translated from Japanese by Stephen Snyder is a dream-like and melancholic story that begins with surveillance state dystopia but ends with surreal and haunting meditation of our sense of Self. It echos the themes of George Orwell's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">1984</a> and Gabriel Garcia Marquez's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude">100 years of solitude</a> but has a power and voice all its own.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of an unnamed island experience a form of gradual and collective amnesia and the psychological toll of forgetting results in physical reality: when objects disappear from memory, they disappear from real life too. The disappearance of objects from memory as well as from real life is enforced by Memory Police, a fascist squad.
Things tend to disappear overnight; in the morning, the islanders—“eyes closed, ears pricked, trying to sense the flow of the morning air”—sense that something has changed. They try to acknowledge these disappearances, gathering in the street and talking about what they are losing. Sometimes the natural world complies, as if in a fairy tale: as roses disappear, a blanket of multicolored petals appears in the river. When birds disappear, people open their birdcages and release their confused pets up to the sky. Less poetic objects—stamps, green beans—vanish, too. Ships and maps are gone, so no one can leave or really understand where they are. A period of hazy limbo surrounds each disappearance. There are components to forgetting: the thing disappears, and then the memory of that thing disappears, and then the memory of forgetting that thing disappears, too.
Memory is always associative; we remember not just the object itself but what it conjures. Birds are byways to flight, lightness, quickness, youth, song, mornings, twilights, migrations. They partake in stories, paintings, metaphors and myths. Each object that is disappeared takes layers of personal and shared knowledge with it.
Forgetting has other aspects too. When the residents forget birds and roses, they forget what these things conjure inside them: flight, freedom, extravagance, desire,</p>
<p>The narrator, who, like the island, is unnamed, is a novelist. Throughout “The Memory Police,” she works on a novel-in-progress about a typist whose voice is vanishing. She’s processing reality through a metaphorical device, re-creating the mechanism of the book that she herself is embedded in. However novelist faces a big challenge as she cannot recall the disappeared things and  and this obstacle gives her language, already reserved, a faintness – an almost translucent feeling. How thin the writing sometimes seems, even as it remains sure and fluid. As losses accumulate and we internalise the workings of this world, the novelist’s understated prose accrues a polyphonic power.</p>
<p>The narrator spends much of her time with an old man, a former ferryman who lives on a boat that now registers to them only as an unusable object. “I mean, things are disappearing more quickly than they are being created, right?” she asks him. She goes on, “It’s subtle but it seems to be speeding up, and we have to watch out. If it goes on like this and we can’t compensate for the things that get lost, the island will soon be nothing but absences and holes, and when it’s completely hollowed out, we’ll all disappear without a trace.” The old man says yes—when he was a child, the island seemed fuller. “But as things got thinner, more full of holes, our hearts got thinner, too, diluted somehow,” he says. Ogawa expresses this attrition in the novel’s unembellished language and the eerie calm that pervades it—as the novel progresses, you feel as if a white fog is slowly thickening. On the island, possibilities are becoming foreclosed both literally and spiritually. </p>
<p>Allegories of collective degeneration have a tendency toward the phantasmagoric, as in José Saramago’s novel “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness_(novel)">Blindness</a>,” which was published in 1997. In that novel, all the people in an unnamed city lose their physical sight, and the place swiftly descends into hellish depths of degradation and despair. But one of the most affecting aspects of “The Memory Police” is the lack of misery in the narrative. At first, this feels comforting, moving—an assurance that life is worth living even in the most reduced circumstances. But then it begins to seem possible that despair itself has been forgotten—that the islanders can’t agonize over the end that’s coming because the idea of endings has also disappeared. The narrator asks her editor R if he thinks that the islanders’ hearts are decaying. “I don’t know whether that’s the right word, but I do know that you’re changing, and not in a way that can be easily reversed or undone. It seems to be leading to an end that frightens me a great deal,” he says.</p>
<p>It’s left to the reader to ask the questions. Who are the Memory Police, with their fine uniforms and empty faces? To whom do they report, and how did they come to hold such absolute power? How is it that all the fruit disappears, or that the snow never melts – that nature itself submits? Are we the Memory Police as well as the ones without memory?</p>
<p>The Memory Police doesn’t lend itself to easy analysis; we cannot say the state is Mao’s China, Pol Pot’s Cambodia or Nazi Germany, or wrap the novel neatly around any specific historical amnesia. It cuts across many centuries and places, reminding us of every people forced to give up possessions, memories, names, languages and words before they themselves were destroyed.</p>
<p>While a reader may feel the need to interpret it solely as a political novel, the book also reads, accurately and passionately, as a profound meditation on dying. In its losses, we see the aching removal of a person from their world. In the twilight of life, memories weaken, friends disappear, objects are lost. The things that once brought pleasure no longer move us. Parts of our bodies succumb, by stroke or paralysis; we can no longer feel our left leg, our right hand. We slip away. What to do, how to refuse, how to mourn? Ogawa’s novel insists that we retain small illuminations; we are the key of a typewriter striking a note, leaving a trace – an R, say – before falling back into silence. </p>
<p>The truths of The Memory Police work slowly, even off-handedly. When the novelist wonders why books burn so well, the old man says: “I suppose because they pack so much paper into such a small object.” When the story arrives at its fruition, its power seems to come out of the thin air and thin existence in which its characters are trapped. Yet the force of its ending is cumulative and phenomenal, and taps into the very source and meaning of memory.</p>
<p>The Memory Police is a masterpiece: a deep pool that can be experienced as fable or allegory, warning and illumination. It is a novel that makes us see differently, opening up its ideas in inconspicuous ways, knowing that all moments of understanding and grace are fleeting. It is political and human, it makes no promises. It is a rare work of patient and courageous vision.</p>
