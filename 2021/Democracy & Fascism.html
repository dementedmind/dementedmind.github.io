                <p><strong>Steven Levitsky</strong> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Democracies_Die">How Democracies Die</a> writes “Most democratic breakdowns have been caused not by generals and soldiers but by elected governments themselves. The path taken to to subvert democracy are legal in the sense they are approved by legislature and/or approved by the courts. They are even portrayed as efforts to improve democracy – making the judiciary more efficient, combating corruption, improving social justice, cleaning up electoral process. Newspapers still publish but are bought off or bullied into self-censorship. Citizens continue to criticize the government but often find themselves facing tax or other legal troubles. This sows public confusion. People do not immediately realize what is happening. Many continue to believe they are living under a democracy.
Because there is no single moment – no coup, declaration of martial law, or suspension of the constitution – in which the regime obviously “crosses the line” into dictatorship, nothing may set off society’s alarm bells. Those who denounce government abuse may be dismissed as exaggerating or crying wolf. Democracy’s erosion is, for many, almost imperceptible. This is how elected autocrats subvert democracy – packing and “weaponizing” the courts and other neutral agencies, buying off the media and the private sector (or bullying them into silence) and rewriting the rules of politics to tilt the playing field against opponents. The tragic paradox of the electoral route to authoritarianism is that democracy’s assassins use the very institutions of democracy – gradually, subtly, and even legally – to kill it.”</p>
<p><strong>Jason Stanley,</strong> in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Fascism_Works">How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them</a>, gives the label ‘fascism’ to ultra-nationalism of some variety (ethnic, religious, cultural, etc.), with the nation represented in the person of an authoritarian leader who speaks on its behalf. Their other strategies include propaganda for perception management; divisive politics of ‘us versus them’; dehumanizing of certain segments of the population; anti-intellectualism (that is, attacking every intellectual activity that challenges their ideas); and law and order, with ‘them’ projected as lawless and ‘us’ as lawful.On an emotional plane, they promote appeal to the great mythic past; ‘victim-hood’ of the majority;sexual anxiety regarding protection of ‘our’ women from ‘them’; and a state of unreality, in which conspiracy theories and fake news replace reasoned debate.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Beauchamp</strong>, global policy expert at <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/13/17823488/hungary-democracy-authoritarianism-trump">Vox</a>, has described the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán as a strongman who has proved that a ruthless party could indeed take durable control of political institutions while still successfully maintaining a democratic veneer.</p>
<p><strong>Roger Cohen</strong>, columnist for the New York Times, has pointed out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/opinion/sunday/orban-hungary-kaczynski-poland.html">in this article</a> that Orbán has established a template, “Neutralize an independent judiciary. Subjugate much of the media. Demonize migrants. Create loyal new elites through crony capitalism. Energize a national narrative of victim-hood and heroism through the manipulation of historical memory. Claim the ‘people’s will’ overrides
constitutional checks and balances.”</p>
<p>Does it rings a bell here?</p>
