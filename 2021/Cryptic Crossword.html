                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Defintion of Cryptic Crossword as per Cambridge Dictionary is "a type of crossword (= word game) that has difficult clues (= pieces of information) that are not obvious in their meaning". Cryptic crossword clues are normally in three parts - A <strong>straight clue (Definition)</strong>, <strong>the answer hidden somehow(Wordplay)</strong> and <strong>words that indicate how it is hidden(Indicator)</strong>. These are made into a sentence, not necessarily in that order, that sort of makes sense literally but usually the wrong sense. The best way to solve a cryptic clue is to see if you can identify the straight clue(Definition). Definition is always either at first (word or phrase) or last (again word or phrase).</p>
<p>The beauty of cryptic crossword clues is that you know when you have the correct answer, not like a normal crossword.</p>
<p>Let us take a few examples.</p>
<p><strong>Outlaw taking shelter in mountain kingdom (6)</strong></p>
<p>Here straight clue or definition part is <strong>mountain kingdom</strong> which can be both locations as well as singular Nouns. The answer is hidden in <strong>outlaw taking shelter</strong> which is also called wordplay.<strong>in</strong>  is indicative of how answer is hidden in wordplay part ie <strong>outlaw taking Shelter</strong>.</p>
<p>'outlaw' becomes 'ban' (banning is a kind of outlawing).</p>
<p>'taking' indicates putting letters inside.</p>
<p>'shelter' becomes 'hut' (hut is a kind of shelter).</p>
<p>'ban' going around 'hut' is 'BHUTAN'.</p>
<p><strong>Noises in restless slumber (7)</strong></p>
<p>Here again definition part is <strong>Noises</strong> and <strong>restless</strong> indicates that we have to use Anagram to find the answer. Anagram of <strong>Slumber</strong> is <strong>rumbles</strong> which means 'a continuous low sound'.</p>
<p>Now we outline a few basic tricks used in solving Cryptic Crossword. In part 1 <strong>Double Definition</strong>, <strong>Anagram</strong> and <strong>Hidden Answers</strong> is Covered. In Part 2 <strong>Homophones</strong>, <strong>Charades</strong>, <strong>Containers</strong> and <strong>Reversals</strong> will be covered.</p>
<h5>DOUBLE DEFINITIONS</h5>
<p>The simplest kind of wordplay hint in a clue is a second definition.
For example, HOOD can mean “gangster” or “a cover for the head.”
So a clue for HOOD might read:</p>
<p><strong>Cover for the head gangster (4)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Baby cow's leg part (4)</strong></p>
<p><strong>CALF</strong> is both Baby Cow and Lower Part of Leg</p>
<p><strong>Hawthorn blossom's month (3)</strong></p>
<p><strong>MAY</strong> is the flowers of the hawthorn tree and also a Month.</p>
<p><strong>Abandon the wasteland (6)</strong></p>
<p><strong>DESERT</strong> means Abandon  as well as wasteland.</p>
<p><strong>Loud noise from a tennis bat (6)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Racket</strong> is a tennis bat as well as an unpleasant continuous noise.</p>
<h5>ANAGRAMS</h5>
<p><strong>Anagram indicator</strong> is a word, or sometimes a brief phrase, indicating that some of the letters of words in the clue need to be jumbled up and rearranged, to find the answer.</p>
<p>So, an anagram indicator can be pretty much any word that gives a sense of things being broken, muddled, jumbled, built, confused, insane, cooked, mixed, damaged, upset, or even drunk! </p>
<p><strong>Insane damn yeti is explosive (8)</strong></p>
<p><strong>insane</strong> is an Anagram Indicator. So we look for synonym of explosive with rearrangement of <strong>damn yeti</strong> and we find <strong>Dynamite</strong> which is explosive. </p>
<p><strong>He cooked planet's animal (8)</strong></p>
<p>This clue gives examples of a couple of cryptic tricks. Firstly, the anagram indicator (cooked) is in the middle of the fodder, not at one end. And secondly, the apostrophe s at the end of planet is not a possessive apostrophe, showing ownership (ie the animal belonging to the planet), but is a contraction of is = it's effectively saying "A cooked version of he + planet is a word for a type of animal". It is <strong>Elephant</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Badly pare the fruit (4)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Badly</strong> is Anagram indicator and we get a fruit <strong>Pear</strong> with rearrangement of <strong>pare</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Flustered, I forget rarer chilly compartment (12)</strong></p>
<p>As the definition has to be at the start or end of the clue, that means it's probably flustered or chilly compartment, or just compartment. However, that flustered does look a bit like an anagram indicator, so let's see if some of the other words in the clue add up to 12 letters. How about "I forget rarer?" This gives us <strong>Refrigrator</strong> - that's a chilly compartment.</p>
<p><strong>Perilous sea dog? Run all over the place! (9)</strong></p>
<p>When first looking at the this clue, see if we can spot the anagram indicator ... it's all over the place. Now, the answer is 9 letters long. What collection of words in the clue add up to 9 letters? Sea dog run works. Now make them go all over the place! Perilous is the definition. This clue highlights another point about cryptics — in general,  ignore the punctuation! Sea dog runs becomes <strong>Dangerous</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Noises in restless slumber (7)</strong></p>
<p><strong>restless</strong> is Anagram indicator and we get <strong>Rumbles</strong> from <strong>Slumber</strong> which mean Continuous noise.</p>
<h1>HIDDEN ANSWERS</h1>
<p>Here the answer will be hidden inside a longer word or phrase eg <strong>Appeal to you to get through an apple a day (5)</strong> (as PLEAD is tucked inside “apPLE A Day” and meaning Appeal).Indicators such as “caught in,” “buried in,” “part of”,"get through" and “housed by.”</p>
<p><strong>Herb's buried in a fil</strong>THY ME<strong>adow (5)</strong>  <strong>Thyme</strong> is a herb.</p>
<p><strong>Pilfer a bit of wa</strong>STE AL<strong>exandrite (5)</strong>  <strong>STEAL</strong> means pilfer.</p>
<p><strong>Scap</strong>EGO<strong>at concealed self esteem (3)</strong></p>
<p><strong>T</strong>APES<strong>try covers primates (4)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Enjoyment from mal</strong>FUN<strong>ction (3)</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Rug held by der</strong>MAT<strong>ologist (3)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Warmth in t</strong>HE AT<strong>rium (4)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lover of birds imprisoned in Al</strong>CAT<strong>raz (3)</strong> Is cat Lover of Birds ?</p>
