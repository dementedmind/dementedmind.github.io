    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Hanif">Mohmmed Hanif</a>'s third novel <a href="https://scroll.in/article/897036/red-birds-mohammed-hanifs-most-sorrowful-novel-is-swallowed-up-by-its-grief">Red Birds</a> is the story of what happens when the war machine collides with innocent civilians. It is part war story with an unflinching exposure to dire human  consequences with a dash of magical realism. It is black farce, searing criticism on American Foreign Policy in Middle east Asia (as writer notes while telling about Major Eille's marital trouble with wife Cathy as metaphor for America's Foreign Policy "<em>I should have known. He liked his weapon more than his wife. It was always easier to bomb some far-off place than stay home and unload the dishwasher</em>") and a brilliant portrayal of a region grappling with conflict and occupation and how different the grassroots' realities really are, compared to the blistering and propaganda-laden images of war, broadcast on mass media. </p>
<p>The story has three narrator's point view - an American fighter pilot Major Ellie, Momo - a 15 year young boy in a refugee camp who considers himself an enterprenuer and  a dog called Mutt.</p>
<p>First protagonist Major Ellie crashes into desert near the refugee camp after failed attempt to bomb the refugee camp (in his words 'a breeding ground of terrorist') "at the end of the world, [a] hideout for some of the worst human scum." The pilot has an undistinguished military career, and this mission was meant to give him the recognition he needed to advance, but the crash puts an end to that. After wandering for eight days in the desert with no food or water, he finds half of his plane: "So this is what I have; the front half of an F15 Strike Eagle with two 500-pound laser-guided bombs, one marked YES, the other marked OH YESS in grey stenciled letters."</p>
<p>Our second protagonist – Momo, a self-styled businessman and the proud owner of a vintage Jeep Cherokee 3600, is concerned about his older brother Ali, who hasn’t been seen since he was “contractually employed” (or sold by his father) to work at a nearby and recently shut down, US Air Force hangar. Momo is given to dark proclamations on the world's moral state. "How're you gonna keep your integrity in a place where thievery is not only accepted but also expected?" he asks early in the book.</p>
<p>Momo’s companion, sometimes irritant, and the novel’s third point of view, is Mutt, a mangy dog who has become an armchair philosopher following an incident with an electricity pole, “in which my brains got fried.” He critiques all other characters and reveals their hidden, internal lives. From his unique vantage point as both a beloved pet and an outsider, Mutt has seen others at their worst and finest moments. Since he is often, both figuratively and literally, at the periphery of the human drama around him, he knows and understands things that no one else does. “Whenever I hear the word ‘care’ or ‘compassion’ on Momo’s lips,” he says at one stage, “I can see dollar signs in his eyes.”</p>
<p>And there walks a pretty USAID consultant – the most obviously satirical character in the book – wanting to study the Muslim teenage mind. She is “conducting a survey on post-conflict resolution strategies that involve local histories and folklore”. Nicknamed “Lady Flowerbody”, she intends “to use this community as a laboratory for testing my hypothesis about how our collective memories are actually our cultural capital … ” She is the embodiment of lazy, tautological bullshit with a purse full of recreational hash. “Let’s admit that things happen on both sides,” she says, as if to offer comfort, then calls her subjects uninvolved. This Trumpian hypocrisy is eerie in the mouth of a character who represents western academia. Momo doesn’t buy into her “do-gooder’s trickery”. Many field scholars have come through bearing chocolate, squeezed him for details, instructed him in western strategies for managing his pain, then written books called The Way of the Nomad or And the Sands Wept and left him with nothing. Momo notes “First they bomb us from the skies, then they work hard to cure our stress ... I am the Young Muslim Mind that will pay for her six-handed massages and her toned skin ...  I get PTSD, she gets a per diem in US dollars.”</p>
<p>As the title implies, there are birds too —wispy red ethereal birds, seen momentarily. Mutt is the first to see the novel’s eponymous red birds. They emerge from the last drop of blood from yet another casualty of war and symbolize the metamorphosis of a world that was unlivable to begin with, into something totally hellish. Mutt does not tell Momo about the birds because he is scared that the boy will try to sell them as well. “Imagine the red birds fluttering in gilded cages. Imagine your most private grief as a party decoration,” remarks the dog.They surface later, through transient seconds. “Red birds are real. The reason we don’t see them is because we don’t want to. Because if we see them, we’ll remember. When someone dies in a raid or a shooting or when someone’s throat is slit, their last drop of blood transforms into a tiny red bird and flies away. And then reappears when we are trying hard to forget them, when we think we have forgotten them, when we think we have learned to live without them, when we utter those stupid words that we have ‘moved on’.”</p>
<p>When a dehydrated and exhausted Ellie crosses paths with Momo and Mutt, the teenage entrepreneur sees it as an opportunity to raid the Hangar along with Ms Flowerbody and bring his brother back home  and there begins a convoluted chess game between the camp inhabitants and the Americans.</p>
<p>The climactic scenes take place in the hangar — an intriguing place, the seemingly abandoned refuelling centre of a US Air Force unit and here it turns into paranormal. The titular Red birds reappear amidst the puffs of red dust in the Hangar while Mother Dear, Momo and Mutt sight them simultaneously during their rescue mission for Ali. Ghosts of the dead, Cath, Colonel Slatter, and Ali suffuse the air with this unnerving dust.</p>
<p>The book jacket of the novel puts it succinctly, ‘Written with Mohammed Hanif’s trademark wit and deadpan irony, Red Birds is a savage, irreverent satire telling important truths about the absurdity of war and impossibility of peace.’</p>
<p><strong>“Red Birds is a piercingly laugh-out-loud novel in a genre that doesn’t often abide comedy. But Hanif pushes his narrative beyond mere irony, expanding his critique of America’s military interventions to include satire, ghost stories and absurdist touches — up to and including a canine narrator that’s usually smarter than any human in the room.”—Washington Post
