    <p>Mohsin Hamid’s 2000 debut novel “Moth Smoke”follows Daru Shezad, a junior banker with short fuse is socially a part of the elite society in Lahore that he cannot truly afford to join. Daru owes both the job and his education to his best friend Ozi's father, Khurram, a corrupt former official of one of the Pakistan regimes who has looked out for Daru ever since Daru's father, an old army buddy of Khurram's, died in the early '70s. Ozi has return from USA where he earned a college degree, with his wife, Mumtaz, and child.</p>
<p>When he loses his job for an outburst in office, the loss of income brings to the fore the widening gap between  him and his friends, classmates and social circle and 
begins his descent into jealousy, drug addiction, adultery and robbery. The wife of his best friend, with whom he is having an affair, is also pulled downward, both risking being burnt up like the titular moths attracted to the flame.</p>
<p>Daru’s insecurity, financial and personal, as he exists on the fringes of elite society mirror that of Pakistani society as a whole and whole Pakistani Society is divided into two groups.</p>
<p><em>“There are two social classes in Pakistan," Professor Superb said to his unsuspecting audience, gripping the podium with both hands as he spoke. "The first group, large and sweaty, contains those referred to as the masses. The second group is much smaller, but its members exercise vastly greater control over their immediate environment and are collectively termed the elite. The distinction between members of these two groups is made on the basis of control of an important resource:air-conditioning. You see, the elite have managed to re-create for themselves the living standards of say, Sweden without leaving the dusty plains of the subcontinent. They're a mixed lot - Punjabi and Pathans, Sindhis and Baluchis, smugglers , mullahs, soldiers, industrialists - united by their residence in an artificially cooled world. They wake up in air-conditioned houses, drive air-conditioned cars to air-conditioned offices, grab lunch in air-conditioned restaurants (rights of admission reserved), and at the end of the day go home to an air-conditioned lounges to relax in front of their wide-screen TVs. And if they should think about the rest of the people, the great uncooled, and become uneasy as they lie under their blankets in the middle of the summer, there is always prayer, five times a day, which they hope will gain them admittance to an air-conditioned heaven, or at the very least, a long, cool drink during a fiery day in hell.”</em> </p>
<p>At a national level, he paints Pakistani society as flirting with their own destruction, again like he and the moth, by testing a nuclear device aimed at “winning” any future conflict with rival India.</p>
<p>The reason that Pakistani society is failing in the novel, both at a national and an individual level, is selfishness. Just as Daru’s decisions are aimed at gaining immediate and maximum pleasure, the consequences be damned, great swathes of society are shown to be doing the same. The entire Pakistani elite have essentially opted out of the functioning of Pakistani society – driving 4×4 cars rather than investing in public road maintenance, attending foreign universities rather than supporting local ones – leaving the masses and the public institutions that they rely on to fend for themselves. Hamid makes it clear that the only result of this strategy is that central budgets get smaller and the state gets weaker, until it inevitably collapses and this view is justified by selfish but pragmatic Ozi.</p>
<p><em>“You have to have money these days. The roads are falling apart, so you need a Pajero or a Land Cruiser. The phone lines are erratic, so you need a mobile. The colleges are overrun with fundos who have no interest in getting an education, so you have to go abroad. And that’s ten lakhs a year, mind you. Thanks to electricity theft there will always be shortages, so you have to have a generator. The police are corrupt and ineffective, so you need private security guards. It goes on and on. People are pulling their pieces out of the pie, and the pie is getting smaller, so if you love your family, you’d better take your piece now, while there’s still some left. That’s what I’m doing. And if anyone isn’t doing it, it’s because they’re locked out of the kitchen.”</em></p>
<p><em>Is it any different here </em>?</p>
<p>Jhumpa Lahiri compared Hamid with F. Scott Fitzgerald for depicting the "slippery ties between the extremely wealthy and those who hover, and generally stumble, in money’s glare". In the New York Review of Books, Anita Desai noted: "One could not really continue to write, or read about, the slow seasonal changes, the rural backwaters, gossipy courtyards, and traditional families in a world taken over by gun-running, drug-trafficking, large-scale industrialism, commercial entrepreneurship, tourism, new money, nightclubs, boutiques... Where was the Huxley, the Orwell, the Scott Fitzgerald, or even the Tom Wolfe, Jay McInerney, or Brett Easton Ellis to record this new world? Mohsin Hamid's novel Moth Smoke, set in Lahore, is one of the first pictures we have of that world."</p>
