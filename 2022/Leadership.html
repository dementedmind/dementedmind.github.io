                <p>There is a general concensus whenever any discussion about politics emerges in a group. The consesus is all politicians are corrupt, liar amd misuses power and flout laws with impunity though often we argue that current regime is better or worse depending on our political inclination. We feel sorry and blame our leaders for all our sufferings and not progressing enough.</p>
<p>But wait. Did anyone stop to ask where these leaders come from? Did they not go to the same schools we did, play in the same streets, suckle from the same mothers we did and receive guidance from the same fathers? Before they became our political leaders where were they? Were they not our friends, our teachers, our doctors, our bosses and our subordinates? And when they were there with us how did we behave when we interacted with them and how did they behave when they interacted with us. Did they not behave just like us; did we not behave like each other? Have we not used our influence and contacts (and also possibly bribe) to provide job to our kith and kin ? Before we (them and us) cooked the accounts and pocketed the company or donor money, what did we (them and us) say to each other? How many contracts did we (them and us) block till we could negotiate a little something for ourselves to finish that house we each were building while we (them and us) sat in that back office in the government building ?</p>
<p>We are captivated by the high profile cases and their effects and fail to acknowledge the effects of the hundreds of incidents taking place everyday within institutions at every level of society. These are acts being committed daily by us the citizens with the cumulative effect of hindering our own country’s development. The local residents encroaching public land while constructing house and regularlizing paperwork with bribery, doctors denying patients access to medical treatment so they can make a little extra money by referring them to a friend’s surgery, journalists ‘exposing’ corruption while slipping brown envelopes into their back pockets from politicians seeking favourable articles from them, NGO leaders protesting against corruption at press conferences and in press statements while expropriating donor funds, politicians hurling accusations of corrupt behaviour at each other while embezzling government and party funds themselves. Teachers, bankers, businessmen and women and public servants all committing acts of corruption in their own spheres with the net effect of corroding the national economy and services. Yet we all harbor the expectation that the country’s future will only improve if the country’s leaders are to change.</p>
<p>The question is, on seeing this endemic corruption and accepting that this a reflection of the state of our nation, on what rationale do we base our expectation that leaders will change? Why do we expect our leaders to behave differently when they acquire political power? The leaders are part of us, originates from us and are doing the exact same thing in their space that we have been doing in ours.</p>
<p>The leaders are just mere reflections of our society. A society without basic ethics, rational thinking and the socialization of truthfulness and principled behavior, by implication, will produce  poor leadership. </p>
