                <p><strong>Portrait and Mirror</strong></p>
<p>In 1949, as India prepared to formally adopt its constitution, Ambedkar spoke to the assembly of lawmakers who had been drafting the document with him for three years. “Will she maintain her independence,” he asked of his homeland and its representatives, “or will she lose it again?” He called for a “social democracy,” even as he also emphasized that India lacked both equality and fraternity. “It is quite possible,” <a href="https://scroll.in/article/802495/why-br-ambedkars-three-warnings-in-his-last-speech-to-the-constituent-assembly-resonate-even-today">Ambedkar warned</a>, “for this new-born democracy to retain its form but give place to dictatorship in fact.”</p>
<p>More than seven decade later, these words appear prophetic.The new book To Kill a Democracy: India’s Passage to Despotism chronicles the specific maladies that obstruct social well-being and have enabled the rise of current Prime Minister. The book also underscores how the circumstances in India parallel those around the world. “Fear of violence, rotten healthcare, widespread feelings of social unhappiness, and daily shortages of food and housing destroy people’s dignity,” journalist Debasish Roy Chowdhury and political theorist John Keane establish early on. “Indignity,” they continue, “is a form of generalized social violence.”</p>
<p>The book challenges the notion that democracies die suddenly, such as in a military coup. But the authors also contest the slow-motion theory, in which the protracted demise of a democratic system is primarily blamed on demagogues inciting mistrust. Both perspectives, Roy Chowdhury and Keane claim, are misguided in their fixation on the “breakdowns” or “miscalculations” within national institutions. What’s happening at the top, in other words, is not the only story.</p>
<p>"There’s a bigger point here, one that’s relevant for the study of democracy, its flourishing and demise, and its possible mutation into a strange new kind of government we call despotism. The key point is that when assessments of democracy and how they are killed concentrate exclusively on governmental dynamics and political games of thrones, they are simply unable to grasp the fundamental significance of the social substructures of any given democracy."</p>
<p>"Democracy is much more than high-level dynamics centred on political parties, elections, legislatures, governments, prime ministers and presidents, civil service bureaucracies, the police, and the armed forces. These institutions of government always rest upon, and draw their strength from, interactions among millions of people living their daily lives in a variety of mediated social settings that stretch from family households, personal friendships, and local communities through to distant workplaces, sporting and leisure venues, and places of worship. Seen in this way, democracy at the ‘upper levels’ of government can function and be durable only if citizens ‘down below’ in everyday life live to the full its norms of equality, freedom, solidarity, and respect for social differences. Democracy is much more than monitory democracy—periodic elections plus a plethora of watchdog bodies that publicly scrutinize, check, and restrain those who exercise power. Democracy is a whole way of life in which people from different walks of social life see eye to eye, rub shoulders, cooperate and compromise, and generally think of themselves as the equals of one another. To speak metaphorically, democracy is a form of social life and self-realization that feeds upon what Hindus call ātman, a shared sense that every living person is bound to others in breath and body, mind and soul, by the innermost essence of equality.</p>
<p>Said differently: democracy understood as the self-government of people through their chosen representatives can happen only when citizens live together non-violently in various social associations and communities and treat each other as equals worthy of respect and dignity. Democracy is more than pressing a button or marking a box on a ballot paper. It goes beyond the mathematical certitude of election results and majority rule. It isn’t the same as attending local public meetings or watching breaking news stories scrawled across a screen. Periyar E.V. Ramasamy, the celebrated Tamil founder of the Self-Respect movement, saw this. Several decades before and after independence, Periyar warned repeatedly that democracy could degenerate into the ‘political gambling’ of elections. In the hands of elected politicians, it might deteriorate into squabbles over ‘bread and fish’ among ‘wastrels and frauds’. And if that happened, as he expected it would, the rituals and rivalries of elected government would sap the spirit and substance of a democracy committed to the social equality and freedom of its members."</p>
<p>To Kill a Democracy examines the gamut of issues in India: health care, hunger, environmental hazards, lethal traffic, dismal public education, the torpor of the justice system, election coercion, the media’s collusion in amplifying “nationalist” narratives, the harassment and imprisonment of journalists and academics accused of “anti-nationalist” activities, sexual and gender-based violence, and recent changes to the constitution itself, which, under the current Hindu nationalist government, have systematically targeted the sizable Muslim minority. The data is dense, the research is staggering, and the outlook is bleak. Overwhelming as the obstacles may appear, however, the power of Roy Chowdhury and Keane’s analysis builds as they accumulate such undeniably damning evidence.</p>
<p>This is a fiercely urgent book, expansively researched and reported. “Despotism isn’t old-fashioned tyranny or military dictatorship,” Roy Chowdhury and Keane caution:</p>
<p>Despotism is rather a new type of strong state led by a demagogue and run by state and corporate poligarchs with the help of pliant journalists and docile judges, a top-down form of government that has the backing of not just law-enforcement agencies but also the backing of millions of loyal subjects who are willing to lend their support to leaders who offer them tangible benefits and daringly rule in the name of “democracy” and “the sovereign people.”</p>
